# Screen Curtain

* Authors: Babbage B.V., Joseph Lee
* Download [development version][1]

This add-on brings NVDA Core issue 7857 to life: adding screen curtain functionality on Windows 8 and later.

To use this add-on, go to NVDA menu/Tools/Screen Curtain. If the item is checked, screen curtain is active, otherwise it is off. You can also assign a command to toggle screen curtain from everywhere. When toggling this feature, NVDA will announce a status message, and in case screen curtain is active when NVDA starts, a tone will be heard.

To ask NVDA to turn on screen curtain while using it, go to NVDA menu/Preferences/Settings/Screen curtain. Check "use screen curtain" checkbox to enable screen curtain, uncheck to disable. You can also configure this setting while profiles other than normal configuration is active so you can use screen curtain while a profile is active (while using an app, for example).

IMPORTANT: this is a proof of concept add-on. Once the [relevant feature is included in NVDA][2], this add-on will be discontinued.
